## How to use this repository

If you are running IPFS and you find something you do not understand, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ipfs/support/issues/new). This repository is to help out new users who are not entirely sure what is going on, or have run into an issue that they're not sure is a bug or not.

If you have issues and would like immediate feedback, there is always the IRC channel, which can be found at irc.freenode.net/#ipfs. Logging issues here, however, would help future users, as well, who can search through the issues to see answers to previous questions.
